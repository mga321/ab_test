# Name:

Website Conversion Rate A/B Test


# Description:

For this project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert", meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer before making their decision.

The project contains 3 parts:
- **Part 1:** Probability and Cleaning the Data
- **Part 2:** A/B Test
- **Part 3:** A Regression Approach


# Programming Environment
- Python version 3.7
- Install requirements.txt file


# The Data:

The datasets ab_data.csv and countries.csv were both provided directly in .csv format.
